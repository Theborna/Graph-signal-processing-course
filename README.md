# Graph Signal Processing Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for the Graph Signal Processing course.

## Contents

- `HW1`-`HW5`: Theoretical homeworks (PDF solutions)
- `CHW1`-`CHW5`: Computer homeworks
  - Code files (Matlab)
  - `report` folder with written reports
- `resources`: Reference materials
  - Books
  - Papers

The theoretical homeworks contain handwritten solutions to problems on key graph signal processing concepts.

The computer homeworks have Matlab code to implement various graph signal processing techniques, along with a report folder discussing the implementation and results.

## Usage Notes

The Matlab code requires the [GSPBox](https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/) toolkit to run. Simply clone this repo and run the scripts in the `code` subfolders.

The written reports detail the implementation and discuss the results.

The resources are useful reference materials for graph signal processing theory and applications.

Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand on any other sections!
